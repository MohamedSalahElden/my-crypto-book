# Chapter 1: Introduction to Cryptography

## What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the science of securing communication by transforming information into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in digital communications.

## Goals of Cryptography
1. **Confidentiality** – Ensures that only authorized users can access information.
2. **Integrity** – Protects data from being altered.
3. **Authentication** – Verifies the identity of users and devices.
4. **Non-repudiation** – Prevents denial of actions taken.

## Types of Cryptography
- **Symmetric Encryption** – Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric Encryption** – Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
- **Hashing** – Generates a fixed-length output that uniquely represents the input data.
